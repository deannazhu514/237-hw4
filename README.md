Game concept: strategic, multiplayer

Title Screen: enter username
Waiting room: Join game, create new game, currently playing games, instructions

When you start a game:
Pick a team of 3 (select different classes: HUMAN, ELF ZOMBIE?). 
Each has basic stats (chance of hit, damage, health, attack range, move range, critical chance, dodge chance)

You can increase stats with your beginning stat points
Background as a chess-like grid terrain (different terrain squares can boost or lower stats or do other wacky stuff)
